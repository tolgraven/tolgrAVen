                            Currently studying computer science, and having picked up some web design chops the past few years to supplement my existing graphics experience, I built this website from scratch as a learning-cum-demo environment.  Then came the point where it started reflecting something real.
                            With a simple CMS, plus blog/comments system with user accounts, it's pretty full-featured and a good representation of my abilities. I think the Clojure and ClojureScript ecosystem seems good in this regard. It's daunting, but the lack of rails, as it were, might force a deeper understanding of each aspect. And it's close enough to the JS ecosystem everyone is in that skills will surely translate.
                            Also, Hiccup is awesome.

                            Well let's see what else. I make music, have dabbled in being a rave promoter, soundboy, am a big enough ally to have hosted gay parties in Uganda, and all-around upstanding chap. I reckon.
                            Finally having reached the level of running my own web design/custom music tech/yada yada actual company, rather than merely on an advanced hobbyist basis, I feel like I've landed right where I belong. Not that I've got anything against working for the man, hint hint.
                            My main focus these days has ended up the web front... not that I, as full stack, am wanting in the back - but in the end it's just not quite as much fun.
                            Meanwhile I will do my best trying to write stuff on the blog - about the process, life in general, I'm not sure yet. All in due time.

                            Leave a comment! Let me build your website! Give me a job!"
